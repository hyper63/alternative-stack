     * Loaders have access to:
     * - Business services
     * - SessionServer
     * - ApiGatewayProxyEvent
     *
     * Business logic is encapsulated, having access to only itself (see ./services/services.ts).
     * This has lots of benefits:
     * - Business logic is framework agnostic and can be reused
     *   - Remix/NextJS/CRA/Preact
     *   - Vue
     *   - Svelte
     *   - CLI :)
     *
     * - Easier to test business logic (unit tests!)
     * - Separation of concerns
     *
