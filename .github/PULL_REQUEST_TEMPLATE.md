<!--

Thank you for helping to improve the Hyper Remix Stack!

Our bandwidth on maintaining these stacks is limited. As a team, we're
currently focusing our efforts on Hyper and Hyper Cloud itself. The good news is you can
fork and adjust this stack however you'd like and start using it today
as a custom stack. Learn more from
[the Remix Stacks docs](https://remix.run/stacks).

If you'd still like to report a bug, please fill out this form. We can't
promise a timely response, but hopefully when we have the bandwidth to
work on these stacks again we can take a look. Thanks!
